IrrigationCaddy
===============

This is a simple library written to interact with the IrrigationCaddy sprinkler controller
by [KGControls LLC](http://irrigationcaddy.com/). It was inspired by
[similar tool](http://sourceforge.net/projects/irrigationcli/) developed by Gerald Hitz.

I developed this because
a) I recently purchased one of these controllers, and
b) my preferred language is Ruby rather than C# as I wanted to use this on a Linux web server.

NOTE: the 'API', such as it is, is not officially documented or supported by KGControls. Thus, it may be
fragile and break with new firmware revisions.
